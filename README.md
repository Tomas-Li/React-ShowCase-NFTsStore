## Showcase page for ReactNative-NFTs-Store application:
## https://github.com/Tomas-Li/ReactNative-NFTs-Store

Here you will find an expo link to run the application from your cellphone (you will need to download the expo app from your app store)

The page works as a showcase for a pure frontend React-Native application (doesn't have a backend, the project was made only looking for an aesthetically appealing look as a practice for mobile devices applications).

Please check out the Showcase page and the Application itself through expo!
